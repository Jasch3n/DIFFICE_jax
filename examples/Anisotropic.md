# Anisotropic viscosity inversion via PINNs

The conventional Shallow-shelf Approximation (SSA) equations is derived under the assumption that ice shelves have 
isotropic properties. However, evidence shows that ice shelves could exhibit anisotropic properties, leading to 
the viscosity inversion from the remote-sensing data and isotropic SSA equation with no viable solution.
