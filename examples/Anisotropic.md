# Anisotropic viscosity inversion via PINNs

The derviation of conventional Shallow-shelf Approximation (SSA) equations assume that ice shelves have isotropic properties. 
However, evidence shows that ice shelves could exhibit anisotropic properties, leading to the inversion of isotropic
viscosity from the remote-sensing data and isotropic SSA equation with no viable solution.
