# Tutorial example for viscosity inversion

This folder provide a tutorial example to infer viscosity from synthentic data of 
ice velocity and thickness via physics-informed neural networks. The synthetic data
is created by considering a flow of ice moving in a given domain. The velocity and
thickness of the ice flow can be obtained by solving the Shallow-shelf Approximation 
equation and steady mass conservation equations numerically.

For the tutorial example provided in this folder,
