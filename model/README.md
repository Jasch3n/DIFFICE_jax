# MODEL for PINNs and XPINNs

This folder provides the core codes for generating neural networks, creating
loss function and predicting output variables for the PINN training on assimilating 
remote-sensing data of ice shelves and infer their effective viscosity. Two versions
of codes are provided in this folder. One is for the **regular PINN** training and the 
other is for **extended-PINN (XPINN)** training. 

The mathematical formation for the regular PINN training is provided in [this link], 
and the description of the XPINNs setting is given in [this link]
